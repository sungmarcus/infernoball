## What I learned (1-2 pages)

Describe what you learned from taking the module.

## What I did (2-4 pages) 

Describe what you did during the module, i.e., how you 
solved the practicals. Include URLs for code/repos but 
not the code itself. If you have more text than fits
in 4 pages, include a link to that additional text but
do make the 4 pages self-contained (other than code).

## Module evaluation (1 page)

Say what you liked/disliked about the module and why.
There's no need to say that RosettaHub is creaky, we
know that:-)
