<li>This helped when reading the papers for the written assignments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What I learnt about Internet of Things: - IoT and its structure. - IoT nodes and their constraints (low resources, low computing power, low memory etc) -</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-i-did-2-4-pages">What I did (2-4 pages)</h2>
<p>Describe what you did during the module, i.e., how you solved the practicals. Include URLs for code/repos but not the code itself. If you have more text than fits in 4 pages, include a link to that additional text but do make the 4 pages self-contained (other than code).</p>
<h2 id="module-evaluation-1-page">Module evaluation (1 page)</h2>
<p>Say what you liked/disliked about the module and why. There’s no need to say that RosettaHub is creaky, we know that:-)</p>
